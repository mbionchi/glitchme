glitchme:
=========

  glitchme is a small utility that will introduce random noise to a stream of
data.  This can be used to create glitch art or to just mess things up -- use
your imagination.

  Usage: glitchme <random factor> <seed (optional)>
         <random factor> must be a floating-point number between 0.0 and 1.0,
            and it corresponds to the approximate percentage of noise you want
            introduced (0.0 is minimum, 1.0 is maximum).
         <seed> must be an int and is used as a seed to the srand function.
            is optional.

  Usage examples:
    $ glitchme 0.00001 < someimage.jpg > corrupted_image.jpg
    $ cat file.txt | glitchme 0.01
    $ for i in {0..19}; do glitchme 0.0001 $RANDOM < img.jpg > img_$i.jpg; done
